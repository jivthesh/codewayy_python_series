#Write a program in python which would include some code working with integers and floats:

#to enter the first number
num1=int(input("Enter first Number:"))
#to enter the second the number
num2=int(input("Enter second Number:"))
#to convert  integer to float ty
num2=float(num2)
#to add two numbers
sum_Num=num1+num2
#to subtract two numbers
sub_Num=num1-num2
#to multiply two numbers
mul_Num=num1*num2
#to divide two numbers
div_Num=num1/num2
#to print the output
print("Sum:",sum_Num)
print("Sub:",sub_Num)
print("Mul:",mul_Num)
print("Div:",div_Num)
